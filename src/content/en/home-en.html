    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Loïc Boiteux and I am a web developer and computer enthusiast.
        This website is a personal space where I showcase my work
        and share my experience.
        You will also find a <a href="https://d34dbyte.xyz/fr/blog/">blog</a>
        where I write about various subjects, such as books, Linux,
        electronics, or anything else that interests me.

    <h2>My blog</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://d34dbyte.xyz/fr/blog/">blog</a> is the ideal place to discover the subjects I'm passionate
        about, in addition to programming. I
        share articles on my readings, my experiments with Linux, my
        discoveries in electronics, and other diverse topics. I hope you find these reads as
        interesting as I had fun writing them.
