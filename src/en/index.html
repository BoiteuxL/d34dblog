                My name is Loïc Boiteux and I'm a web developer with a passion
                for computers.
                This website is a personal space where I showcase my work and
                share my experiences.
                You'll also find a <a
                    href="https://d34dbyte.xyz/fr/blog/">blog</a> where I write
                about various
                topics, including books, Linux,
                electronics and anything else that interests me.
